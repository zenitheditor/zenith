///    ([`super::shape::WordSource::paragraph`]); a word whose paragraph differs
///    from the line being filled forces a line break, so a line never mixes
///    paragraphs and every [`Line::paragraph`] is well-defined. A single-paragraph
///    document (every index 0) never triggers this, so output is unchanged.
///
/// 2. **Hyphenation.** When `hyph` is `Some` and a word does NOT fit the
///    remaining space on a NON-EMPTY line, the packer tries to split it at the
///    last embedded break point whose `fragment-` head fits the remaining width
///    ([`try_hyphenate`]); the head joins the current line and the tail is

///    flows whole to the next line exactly as before. `hyph == None` skips this
///    entirely, so the default path is byte-identical.
///
/// 3. **Break-word.** When `hyph` is `Some(ctx)` with `ctx.break_word`, a word
///    that still does not fit AFTER the hyphenation attempt (failed/disabled) is
///    broken at a CHARACTER boundary ([`try_break_word`]) so an unbreakable token
