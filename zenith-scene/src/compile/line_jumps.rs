//! Opt-in connector "line jumps": deterministic hops drawn where two top-level
//! connector polylines cross each other.
//!
//! This is page furniture, run by [`compile_page`](super::compile_page) as a
//! post-pass over the already-emitted scene commands when the page declares
//! `line-jumps="arc"` or `line-jumps="gap"`. With no such property the pass
//! never runs and the scene is byte-identical.
//!
//! Two styles are supported:
//! - `arc`: replace the crossing segment with a small semicircular bump centred
//!   on the crossing point, on a fixed side, so the hopping line reads as
//!   stepping over the line it crosses.
//! - `gap`: break the crossing segment, leaving a small gap centred on the
//!   crossing point, so the hopping line reads as passing under.
//!
//! WHO HOPS (deterministic): at each crossing the HORIZONTAL segment hops over a
//! VERTICAL one. When the two segments are not a clean horizontal/vertical pair
//! (e.g. two diagonals), the connector that appears LATER in document order
//! hops. Crossings are PROPER only — a shared endpoint or a mere touch does not
//! count.
//!
//! ROTATED CONNECTORS: crossings are computed in ON-PAGE (post-rotation)
//! coordinates. A connector under exactly ONE `PushTransform` (a rotation) is
//! mapped to its on-page route for detection, and any hop geometry built in
//! on-page space is mapped back through the inverse rotation before being
//! written into its local `points`. A connector under TWO OR MORE nested
//! rotations is excluded (rare; kept simple). A depth-0 connector has the
//! identity transform, which is a true no-op: its on-page points equal its raw
//! points and the written-back points are byte-identical to the unrotated path.
