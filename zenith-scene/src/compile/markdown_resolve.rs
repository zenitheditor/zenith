//! Markdown-resolution pass: for each `text` node whose `content_format` is
//! `"markdown"`, concatenate the current span texts (AFTER data-binding
//! substitution) into one string and replace `node.spans` with the styled spans
//! produced by [`zenith_core::parse_inline_markdown`].
//!
//! This pass runs right after [`super::data_resolve::substitute_data_refs`] in
//! the compile entry ([`super::compile_page`]) so that data-bound spans (whose
//! text was substituted from the `DataContext` in the previous pass) are also
//! parsed as markdown when `format="markdown"` is set.
//!
//! ## Byte-identical guarantee
//!
//! A `text` node WITHOUT `content_format` (or with `content_format = Some("plain")`)
//! is skipped entirely. Its spans are not touched, so all existing documents
//! (and any authored without `format=`) produce exactly the same output as before.
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! Pure transform: iterates pages and nodes in document order, no HashMap, no
//! time, no randomness. Same input → same output.
