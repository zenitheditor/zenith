//! Multi-page table flow ("table chain") pre-pass.
//!
//! A *table flow* is the set of `table` nodes that share the same `flows` id. A
//! single logical table whose rows overflow its artboard continues onto
//! author-placed continuation `table` boxes on later pages, repeating its header
//! rows on every member. This mirrors the threaded text-chain system in
//! [`super::chain`]: the FIRST member (page-order, then source-order) is the
//! SOURCE — it carries ALL the body rows plus the column definitions; each
//! continuation member declares the same `flows` id with EMPTY rows and receives
//! the body-row slice that fits its own box height, with the source's header
//! rows cloned in front.
//!
//! This module runs ONCE per document (across ALL pages), BEFORE the main
//! compile walk, producing a single [`TableFlowAssignments`] map keyed by member
//! table id. [`super::table::compile_table`] consults that map: a flow member
//! renders its ASSIGNED rows + columns instead of its own; a non-flow table is
//! wholly unaffected (byte-identical).
//!
//! ## v0 design choices (documented)
//!
//! - **Content source.** The flow's content is the rows of the FIRST member
//!   (page-then-source order). Continuation members declare `flows=id` with empty
//!   `row` children. Only the source's rows are distributed; continuation rows
//!   (if any author error leaves some) are ignored in favor of the assigned
//!   slice.
//! - **Header repetition.** The first `header-rows` rows of the source are the
//!   header block, cloned to the front of every member's assigned slice so the
//!   existing `is_header` logic in `compile_table` styles them on every page.
//! - **Row granularity.** Rows are never split mid-row. A `rowspan` group that
//!   would straddle a member boundary is pushed WHOLE to the next member. If a
//!   single group is taller than an entire member box it is placed anyway and
//!   clipped per-cell (a `table.flow_overflow` advisory is emitted).
//! - **Last member.** The final member takes all remaining body rows even if they
//!   overflow its box (its per-cell clip handles the overflow), mirroring the
//!   chain's last-member policy.
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! Members are collected in document (page, then source) order via a depth-first
//! walk into frames/groups, grouped by id in a [`BTreeMap`]. The result is keyed
//! by node id. Measurement reuses the deterministic `compute_table_layout`. No
//! `HashMap`/time/random reaches output.
