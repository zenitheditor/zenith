//! Clap argument types for the Zenith CLI.
//!
//! This module defines the top-level [`Cli`] struct and the [`Command`]
//! subcommand enum. No business logic lives here — just argument shapes.
//!
//! Per-command-group arg structs live in submodules and are re-exported here
//! so that all existing `crate::cli::*` paths continue to resolve unchanged.
//!
//! Submodules:
//! - `asset` — `AssetArgs`, `AssetSub`, `AssetImportArgs`, `AssetZpxBakeArgs`.
//! - `library` — `LibraryArgs`, `LibrarySub`, and library item arg types.
//! - `plugin` — `PluginArgs`, `PluginSub`, `ScopeArg`, `AgentFlags`, and install/uninstall args.
//! - `render` — `RenderArgs`.
//! - `schema` — `SchemaArgs`, `SchemaSub`.
//! - `workspace` — `WorkspaceArgs`, `WorkspaceSub`, scratch, candidate, and promote arg types.
