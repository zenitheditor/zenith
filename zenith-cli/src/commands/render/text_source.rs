//! External-file text-source resolution for `text` nodes with `src="path"`.
//!
//! This module is part of the CLI render layer (not `zenith-scene`) because
//! file I/O must not happen inside the pure scene compile. The single public
//! entry point [`resolve_text_sources`] is called in every render entry point
//! after `parse_validate` and before `compile_page`.

use zenith_core::{Diagnostic, Document, Node, TextNode, TextSpan};

/// Walk every page's node tree and, for each `text` node with `src = Some(path)`,
/// read the file (resolved relative to `project_dir`) and replace the node's
/// `spans` with a single plain span carrying the file's raw UTF-8 text.
///
/// When `project_dir` is `None`, all `src`-bearing text nodes receive a
/// `text.src_missing` Error diagnostic and their spans are left unchanged
/// (there is no directory to resolve the path against).
///
/// A successful read produces a single [`TextSpan`] with all style fields set to
/// `None` — the node's own fill/font apply at compile time, and the
/// `markdown_resolve` pass will re-parse the content if `format="markdown"`.
///
/// On read failure (file missing, unreadable, or not valid UTF-8), a
/// `text.src_missing` Error diagnostic is pushed naming the node id and the
/// resolved path; the node's existing spans are left unchanged so the document
/// degrades gracefully in advisory contexts. The Error severity ensures the
/// same render gate used for `asset.missing` blocks output.
///
/// Determinism: given the same file contents the output is always the same
/// single span — no timestamps or randomness are introduced.
