/// The library subsystem is a set of reusable **packs** — collections of design
/// assets that you materialize into a `.zen` document.  A pack is identified by
/// a package id such as `@zenith/filters`, and each pack exports one or more
/// named **items** addressed as `<package>#<item>` (e.g.
/// `@zenith/flowchart#decision`).
///
/// Three item kinds exist:
///
/// * **token** — a filter or mask token (e.g. `@zenith/filters#sepia`).  Added
///   to the document's `tokens` block; apply with `filter=(token)"sepia"` or
///   `mask=(token)"vignette"` on any node.
/// * **component** — a reusable node group (e.g. a flowchart shape) that is
///   materialized as an `instance` on a named page.  Requires `--page <id>`.
/// * **action** — a canned transaction op sequence (e.g.
///   `@zenith/brand-kit#apply-2026`) that mutates the target document's tokens
///   or layout.  No page required.
///
/// Embedded `@zenith/*` packs are bundled in the binary; project-local packs
/// live in `<project-dir>/libraries/*.zen` and shadow the embedded ones.
