//! The top-level `provenance` block records per-node origin metadata: each
//! `origin` entry records WHERE a document node came from (which library/package
//! and item). It is a sibling of the `assets`/`libraries`/`sections` blocks. The
//! engine preserves and validates these records — each references a node id AND a
//! declared library id that must exist — but does NOT act on the link state; the
//! `linked` flag is round-tripped for external tooling.
